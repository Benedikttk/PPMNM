The public class vec, can be found in vec.cs and is read through the vec.llb. There you can see all of its opperations.
We start by adding to vectors together, vector u and vector v.
u=1 2 3
v=2 3 4
u+v=3 5 7

 We now define 2 more vectors - a, b. and subtract them and make one of them negative.
a=3 4 5
b=4 5 6
a-b=-1 -1 -1
-a=-3 -4 -5

 Now we see if we can do scallar multiplication on our vectors, with a scallar, w=a*5. Note that if using (5*a).print this will give a value, but (a*5).print will grant an error as it is a bug in all c programs.
a*5=15 20 25

 We are now going to find the dot product between two vectors, a, v-> dot(a,v)=38
